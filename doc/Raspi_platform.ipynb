    "This tutorial explain the functionality of the library, which realize the communication between the single board computer and the micro-controller. The communication is based on the serial interface (UART), if the nucleo micro-controller and the Raspberry Pi are connected, than have to appear an device file in the /dev folder. In the most cases this file is named ttyAMC0 (ttyACM?). If you want to control the robot, you need to transmit the commands over the serial interface. You can write a new library for it in other language, like C/C++ or you can use our implemented library in Python language."
